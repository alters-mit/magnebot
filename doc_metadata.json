      "description": "These functions move or turn the Magnebot.\n\nWhile moving, the Magnebot might start to tip over (usually because it's holding something heavy). If this happens, the Magnebot will stop moving and drop any objects with mass > 30. You can then prevent the Magnebot from tipping over.",

      "description": "These functions move and bend the joints of the Magnebots's arms.\n\nDuring an arm articulation action, the Magnebot is always \"immovable\", meaning that its wheels are locked and it isn't possible for its root object to move or rotate.\n\nFor more information regarding how arm articulation works, [read this](../arm_articulation.md).",
