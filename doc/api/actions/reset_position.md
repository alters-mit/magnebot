# ResetPosition

`from magnebot.reset_position import ResetPosition`

Reset the Magnebot so that it isn't tipping over.
This will rotate the Magnebot to the default rotation (so that it isn't tipped over) and move the Magnebot to the nearest empty space on the floor.
It will also drop any held objects.

This will be interpreted by the physics engine as a _very_ sudden and fast movement.
This action should only be called if the Magnebot is a position that will prevent the simulation from continuing (for example, if the Magnebot fell over).

***

## Fields

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`ResetPosition()`**

(no parameterS)

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | [How image data will be captured during the image.](../image_frequency.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to initialize this action.

#### get_ongoing_commands

**`self.get_ongoing_commands(resp, static, dynamic)`**

Evaluate an action per-frame to determine whether it's done.


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |

_Returns:_  Tuple: An `ActionStatus` describing whether the action is ongoing, succeeded, or failed; A list of commands to send to the build if the action is ongoing.

## Functions

#### set_status_after_initialization

**`self.set_status_after_initialization()`**

In some cases (such as camera actions) that finish on one frame, we want to set the status after sending initialization commands.
To do so, override this method.

#### get_end_commands

**`self.get_end_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | [How image data will be captured during the image.](../image_frequency.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands that must be sent to end any action.
