# MoveTo

`from magnebot.actions.move_to import MoveTo`

Turn the Magnebot to a target position or object and then move to it.

This action has two "sub-actions": A [`TurnBy`](turn_by.md) and a [`MoveBy`](move_by.md).

## Class Variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `JOINT_ORDER` | Dict[Arm, List[ArmJoint]] | The order in which joint angles will be set. | `{Arm.left: [ArmJoint.column,` |

***

## Fields

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.

## Functions

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`MoveTo(target, resp, dynamic, collision_detection)`**

**`MoveTo(target, resp, arrived_at=0.1, aligned_at=1, arrived_offset=0, dynamic, collision_detection, previous=None)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| target |  Union[int, Dict[str, float] |  | The target. If int: An object ID. If dict: A position as an x, y, z dictionary. If numpy array: A position as an [x, y, z] numpy array. |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| arrived_at |  float  | 0.1 | If at any point during the action the difference between the target distance and distance traversed is less than this, then the action is successful. |
| aligned_at |  float  | 1 | If the difference between the current angle and the target angle is less than this value, then the action is successful. |
| arrived_offset |  float  | 0 | Offset the arrival position by this value. This can be useful if the Magnebot needs to move to an object but shouldn't try to move to the object's centroid. This is distinct from `arrived_at` because it won't affect the Magnebot's braking solution. |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |
| collision_detection |  CollisionDetection |  | [The collision detection rules.](../collision_detection.md) |
| previous |  Action  | None | The previous action, if any. |

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | [How image data will be captured during the image.](../image_frequency.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to initialize this action.

#### set_status_after_initialization

**`self.set_status_after_initialization()`**

In some cases (such as camera actions) that finish on one frame, we want to set the status after sending initialization commands.
To do so, override this method.

#### get_ongoing_commands

**`self.get_ongoing_commands(resp, static, dynamic)`**

Evaluate an action per-frame to determine whether it's done.


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to send to the build to continue the action.

#### get_end_commands

**`self.get_end_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | [How image data will be captured during the image.](../image_frequency.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands that must be sent to end any action.
