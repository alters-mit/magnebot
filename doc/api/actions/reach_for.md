# ReachFor

`from magnebot.actions.reach_for import ReachFor`

Reach for a target position. The action ends when the magnet is at or near the target position, or if it fails to reach the target.
The Magnebot may try to reach for the target multiple times, trying different IK orientations each time, or no times, if it knows the action will fail.

## Class Variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `JOINT_ORDER` | Dict[Arm, List[ArmJoint]] | The order in which joint angles will be set. | `{Arm.left: [ArmJoint.column,` |

## Fields

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

## Functions

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`ReachFor(target, absolute, arm, orientation_mode, target_orientation, dynamic)`**

**`ReachFor(target, absolute, arrived_at=0.125, arm, orientation_mode, target_orientation, dynamic)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| target |  np.array |  | The target position. |
| absolute |  bool |  | If True, `target` is in absolute world coordinates. If `False`, `target` is relative to the position and rotation of the Magnebot. |
| arrived_at |  float  | 0.125 | If the magnet is this distance or less from `target`, then the action is successful. |
| arm |  Arm |  | [The arm used for this action.](../arm.md) |
| orientation_mode |  OrientationMode |  | [The orientation mode.](../ik/orientation_mode.md) |
| target_orientation |  TargetOrientation |  | [The target orientation.](../ik/target_orientation.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | [How image data will be captured during the image.](../image_frequency.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to initialize this action.

#### set_status_after_initialization

**`self.set_status_after_initialization()`**

In some cases (such as camera actions) that finish on one frame, we want to set the status after sending initialization commands.
To do so, override this method.

#### get_ongoing_commands

**`self.get_ongoing_commands(resp, static, dynamic)`**

Evaluate an action per-frame to determine whether it's done.


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to send to the build to continue the action.

#### get_end_commands

**`self.get_end_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  MagnebotStatic |  | [The static Magnebot data.](../magnebot_static.md) |
| dynamic |  MagnebotDynamic |  | [The dynamic Magnebot data.](../magnebot_dynamic.md) |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | [How image data will be captured during the image.](../image_frequency.md) |

_Returns:_  A list of commands that must be sent to end any action.
